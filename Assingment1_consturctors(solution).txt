Object Orientation >> Assingment 1 (Constructor)

1. Parent
    Derived
    Derived

2. Output can't be shown because the constructor Coordinate is not     correctly defined during object creation. Parameters must be     passed to it.
    If it was like 
	Coordinate p = new Coordinate(3,2);
    Then the output would have been
	x = 3, y = 2

3. x = 5

4. Compile time error because foo() in SuperClass has lesser scope than foo() in Child. [ scope of a method in parent class must be greater than scope of method in child class ]

5. Don't know the answer.
    I've tried this in Netbeans and the answer was "In String". Please     explain.
