1. By using "Interface", multiple inheritance is allowed in Interface.

2. By making it "Private".

3. Don't know.(doubt)

4. I guess yes.(doubt)

5. no, because a field or method without access modifier is "default". And default methods can only be used within same package
 
6. Can't be "private" but can be "protected" because when class is private it won't allow anyone to inherit it's properties.
